Stock Data application:

    Searching the data and showing it in a table or in a graph:

        Adding a scrollbar to the data table veiw widget
        ? Adding the symbol to the plot's title

    Technical analysis:

        In the same GUI, add a 'Technical analysis toolbox' button that directs the user to another window called 'Technical analysis toolbox'
        When the user clicks this button, it automatically fetches all the data from the given stock and saves it and reuses the saved data to don't reuse the API
        Then it offers options on what technical indicator the user would like to see
        The user than can choose the indicator (maybe multiple indicators at once) and veiw it on a graph with the respected data

        Another part of this window is the 'Built-in Analysis' which does some *magic calculations* (to be called later) and provides an overall suggestion on that stock
        Buy, hold sell  OR IDEA: Stong Buy, Buy, hold, Sell, Strong sell --> probably will need to use a scale for that





        Current:
            The "Technical analysis" works as a subclass, the buttons for the indicators are added to "Technical Analysis Toolbox" window.
            The MACD button works, it shows an interactive diagram which might need a little tuning, but overall badass looking
            ? Make sure the calculations are okay, because the results look a little weird compared to the project we did last semeseter (most likely this one is THE good one)

            Next up:
            It would be better, to have two seperate functions for each indicator:
            1. Calc_indicator(self):
                self.ta_data_indicator = self.ta.ta_data_indicator.indicator() MAKE SURE TO APPEND
            
            2. Plot_indicator(self):
                
                Calc_indicator() # recall the calculation function
                plotting the indicator

            The reason to this is the "Built-in Analysis" function.
            When I am going to build that function, it can safely recall on all the other indicators, and I will have a 
            big table with all the indicators (that's why the APPEND is important)
